Raptor Changes
--------------
* Improve correctness check for RowType columns.
  Add specific validation checks for the individual fields when validating a row column.
* Remove unused FilterVoidLambda interface in ArrayFilterFunction
* Add table_supports_delta_delete property in Raptor to allow deletion happening in background. DELETE queries in Raptor can now delete data logically but relying on compactors to delete physical data.
