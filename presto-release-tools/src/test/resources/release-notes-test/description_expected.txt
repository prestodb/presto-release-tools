# Extracted Release Notes
- #1 (Author: A Brown): release notes 1
  - Change ``storage.data-directory` from path to URI. For existing deployment on local flash, a scheme header "file://" should be added to the original config value.
  - Rename error code from ``RAPTOR_LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM_ERROR`` to ``RAPTOR_FILE_SYSTEM_ERROR``.
  - Fix an issue where DATE_TRUNC may produce incorrect results at certain timestamp in America/Sao_Paulo.
  - Replace the ``SchemaTableName`` parameter in ``ConnectorMetadata#createView`` with a ``ConnectorTableMetadata``.
- #2 (Author: C Davis): release notes 2
  - Improve correctness check for RowType columns. Add specific validation checks for the individual fields when validating a row column.
  - Remove unused FilterVoidLambda interface in ArrayFilterFunction.
  - Add table_supports_delta_delete property in Raptor to allow deletion happening in background. DELETE queries in Raptor can now delete data logically but relying on compactors to delete physical data.
  - Change ``ConnectorMetadata#commitPartition`` into async operation, and rename it to ``ConnectorMetadata#commitPartitionAsync``.
