# Extracted Release Notes
- #1 (Author: user1): release notes 1
  - Change `storage.data-directory` from path to URI. For existing deployment on local flash, a scheme header "file://" should be added to the original config value.
  - Change error code name `RAPTOR_LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM_ERROR` to `RAPTOR_FILE_SYSTEM_ERROR`.
- #2 (Author: user2): release notes 2
  - Add table_supports_delta_delete property in Raptor to allow deletion happening in background. DELETE queries in Raptor can now delete data logically but relying on compactors to delete physical data.
  - Change ``ConnectorMetadata#commitPartition`` into async operation, and rename it to ``ConnectorMetadata#commitPartitionAsync``.
